# Bazzite Plus

## My Variant of Bazzite, for Nvidia (1600+) and Non-Nvidia Users. 



## Bazzite Plus changes bazzite slighlty, removing certain customizations to the Desktop Environment, as these are something that many people change anyway. 

## Lutris has been removed, as Bottles is what I prefer to use.


##### This variant of bazzite is based on the :latest branch, however, between Major Fedora Releases, it will be rebased to the most STABLE VERSION OF FEDORA UPSTREAM
